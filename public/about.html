        </div>

        <p class="aboutPara">Kovee the Clown has always been a source of pure joy and positivity. They are a content creator and an entertainer of many. They have a following of more than 200 viewers, and their main goal is to touch as many hearts as they can.  They are an actor and have performed in various plays, their most recent being Rocky Horror Picture Show where they played as Brad Majors. They are a trained voice actor, majored in Mass Communications, and minored in Theatre. A hard worker, they have made a fun-loving and absurd visual novel based on their old Vtuber model, which took six long months of hard programming and dedicated (yet lighthearted) writing. Kovee was not always a clown, but became one after much self-reflection and meditation. Taking on the suggestions from their loved ones, they decided that clownery was the perfect descriptor of who they were at their very core. They knew they were to live a life of color, merriment, and entertainment for many to come. They are currently making a second visual novel which is intended to star their current model as the leading protagonist.
